# Steam Games Contexto
With the number of video games increasing every year, finding new games that match players' tastes can be difficult. Inspired by the game [Contexto](https://contexto.me/), where players guess words based on how similar they are to a hidden word, we want to create a game that lets players explore game similarities in a fun and interactive way. In our game, players will guess different games based on how similar they are to a target game.
